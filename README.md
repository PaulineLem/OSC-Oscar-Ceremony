# OSC-Oscar-Ceremony
### Disparities in the Oscars' results (2001-2017)

The 2020 Oscar Ceremony took place on February, 10th and has been followed by different controversies (for instance regarding the fact that no female directors were nominated).
The aim of our project is to find out whether or not an American actor/ actress under 35 is more likeley to win an oscar thanks to his/her age and nationality. 

We chose to focus on the Oscars' results of the last 20 years for the following categories :
- Best actress in a leading role
- Best actor in a leading role
- Best actress in a second role
- Best actor in a second role

**Authors**
